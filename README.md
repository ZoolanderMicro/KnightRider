  Exercise_Chap05_KnightRider
  This is an exercise taken from the book:
  Beginning C for Arduino 2nd Ed (Jack Purdum)
  Knight Rider Kit car sweeping lights. This 
  version uses 'while' loops to count through
  an array of digital output pins. Notice that 
  the loop control variable is declared static 
  and initialized with a value of 0. It is shared
  between the loops in the main body of the 
  program like a game of hot potato. Also, the
  constant 'MAX_COUNT' is initialized in a way
  that scales to the index of the last array element.
  This works for different array sizes and variable types.
  Thnx Jack ;-)
